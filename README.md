# Data Visualization Final Project

_Due date: Monday, 27 Apr 2018 11:59 pm_

With the end of the term approaching, it is important to make consistent progress toward completing your final visualization projects. To that end, you will demonstrate the current state of your work by submitting a rough prototype of your visualization.

## Goals

The purpose of this assignment is to:

- Ensure that you are making steady progress toward completing your final visualization.
- Show your instructor your work so far and demonstrate that you are in track to finish by the end.
- Practice with an iterative design and development process, revising your work as you go.

## Prerequisites

* I assume that you are up to date with all course readings through Cairo Profiles and Murray 12, and have obtained Murray's [code samples](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/archive/v2.0.3.zip).
* You must have had sufficient experience building infographics and analyzing and designing visualizations by successfully completing previous assignments.

## Requirements

Your final project must meet the following requirements:

1. _Load and cleanup the data._ Basic loading of the dataset and trimming of unnecessary rows/features should be done at this point.

2. _Layout and design is apparent._ Your project should effectively use HTML+CSS+JS/D3 to display the major elements of the application as indicated in your design and sketches. IT is okay if you have since changed some elements of your original idea, but the structure of your current design should be apparent.

3. _Basic implementation of each chart/view._ You must at least have a rudimentary static graphic for each chart/view that is planned for your visualization.

4. _One example of user interaction._ You should at least demonstrate one interactive feature for at least one chart/view.

4. _Narrative content._ You must include text and other (e.g., pictorial) narrative content that introduces and explains the data and the "story" you wish to tell. The overall feel of the visualization should be there.

5. _Metadata._ Include the course number, your name, the date, and citations for your data source(s) in a footer at the bottom of the page.

## Deliverables

Submit your work by add, committing, and pushing all files needed to run your application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to your assignment repository on GitHub Classroom before the due date.
